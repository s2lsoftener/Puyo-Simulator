> A new Puyo Puyo simulator

One of my first attempts at making a Puyo Puyo chain simulator. I tried making it with GSAP and vue.js, but all the DOM updates really lagged in certain web browsers. If you want to see more functional chain simulators, see:

* Vue.js/VuePress guide website: https://github.com/s2lsoftener/PuyoGuides
* TypeScript rewrite (latest attempt): https://github.com/s2lsoftener/puyosim-ts

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run e2e tests
npm run e2e

# run all tests
npm test
```
